# hello-world
My first GitHub repository for "storing" IDEAS and RESOURCES, and "sharing" and "discussing" things with others.

About Me:

I am an experienced Software Engineering Manager with background in Quality Engineering and Quality Assurance. I have managed resources globally to produce quality work from junior and senior-level staff on some of the most challenging technical projects, for which I’ve received awards. I have a passion for being organized and efficient. I promote a culture of continuous improvement through innovation and creativity, rather than accepting the status quo. I lead by example, and guide my associates to be self-accountable and detail-oriented in work habits.

My experience is diverse and spans many verticals. I have an appreciation of how interconnected industries are in the global economy. It is through this exposure that I’ve grown to be flexible and accommodating. Industry exposure:

•	Computer Hardware & Accessories
•	Telecommunications
•	Automotive Electronics
•	Pharmaceutical
•	Energy & Power
•	Process & Petrochemical
•	Aerospace

Through this life-long journey, I have built an admiration for the unique qualities associated with any given corporate culture. And, how project valuations, from thousands of dollars to a couple of billion dollars, can affect the structure of organizations.

As a Software Engineering Manager, I’ve gained insight into the complexities of producing world-class applications and solutions. Working through various frameworks, methods, and tools (e.g., Waterfall, Agile/Scrum, SEI CMM, Fagan Inspections, etc.). I have learned that the one common thread among all production efforts is customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this translates to smart and disciplined approaches to testing, unveiling faults early in the development process, and learning from mistakes.

Professional Interests: Business Analytics, Databases, Market-Driven Management, Total Quality Management, Information & Technology Management, Real-Time Strategy, Quality Engineering, Quality Assurance, Process Improvement, Agile/Scrum, Embedded Systems, Home Automation
